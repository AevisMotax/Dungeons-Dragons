Hello welcome to our Advanced C++ game.
Each part of the game is visible when running the driver.cpp file in VS. 
The first screen will contain your character creator which randomly generates a character and it's stats for you.
Then the game will commence. The game generates a random map every time you play. The map includes enemies, chest, mountains and water.
Water(~): Water tiles kill you.
Mountain(M): Mountain tiles block your character from walking.
Enemy(V): Enemies will start a battle sequence.
Chest(H): Chests will give a random item that improves your character's stats.
Player(O): This is your character. Used the arrow keys to move him.
The dice have no direct implementation yet but you can press d to peform a dice roll.
The items can be seen when opening a chest in the game.

Hope you have fun (:
